Library Management System | Python Project

Developed an interactive Library Management System with advanced functionalities to streamline book management, borrowing, and analytics within a virtual library environment.

	•	Enhanced Book Management: Designed a robust structure using Python dictionaries and lists to manage large datasets efficiently. Implemented multi-copy tracking, enabling dynamic addition, removal, and inventory management of books.
	•	User Authentication & Role-Based Access: Integrated secure user authentication (using getpass library) to protect administrative actions like adding or removing books, ensuring only authorized users can modify records.
	•	Search & Filtering Capabilities: Developed an intuitive search system that allows users to filter books by title, author, or genre. The system employs case-insensitive matching for a seamless user experience, showcasing advanced string manipulation techniques.
	•	Borrowing & Due Date Tracking: Automated due date assignments for borrowed books, leveraging the datetime library for date handling. Designed a feature to calculate overdue fees, with a flexible structure to adjust fees per day, improving accountability and library integrity.
	•	Error Handling & Input Validation: Built comprehensive input validation to manage user errors and edge cases, preventing crashes and enhancing program stability. Clear, concise error messages guide users through corrections, improving usability.
	•	Library Analytics Module: Developed an analytics module to report on book statistics, including total inventory, borrowed counts, and genre popularity, providing insights into library usage and resource demands.
